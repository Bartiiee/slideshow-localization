# Slideshow Digital Signage software - localizations and translations

This repository contains localization files for Slideshow software.

## How to contribute

If you want to fix existing translation or add translation for language that isn't here yet, **feel free to create pull request** or create an issue. I will be happy to merge it (or fix it) and it will be added to the following release of Slideshow software.

Localization of Slideshow software is divided into two parts (see two folders in the repository), please update both parts (otherwise I will have to use Google Translate and that might not be pretty :)):
- **backend** - one file for each language, key=value format
- **web-interface** - one file for all languages, JavaScript format: `localization.lang["key"] = "value";`

Use UTF-8 encoding for the files.

## Current languages:
- Czech (thanks to Ale≈° Obst)
- English
- Italian (thanks to Michele Fioretti)
- Polish (thanks to Piotr Bujalski)
- Slovak
